  link.bsmnt.pro â€” a serverless & minimalist URL shortener that doesn't try to do too much.

  Usage:
      ./generate <url to redirect> <slug>

  Example:
      ./generate https://github.com/basement-works github
      -- will redirect /github to https://github.com/basement-works

      ./generate https://github.com/basement-works/link.bsmnt.pro
      -- will redirect /<auto-generated> to https://github.com/basement-works/link.bsmnt.pro

  Notes:
      Auto-generated slug can only be used if you have openssl(1) installed on your machine.
